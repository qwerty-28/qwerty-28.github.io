        <h2> What is Spam musubi? </h2>

        <p>
        Spam musubi is a local Hawaiian snack. It is a small portable snack made with three main ingredients: spam, rice and seaweed.

        The ham is placed on a bed of rice and the whole thing is wrapped in seaweed. They are affordable, convenient and very tasty.

        In Hawaii, Spam musubi can be found everywhere, including 7-Eleven, supermarket delis and family food places. It can also be made at home.
        </p>


        <h2> Where does Spam musubi come from? </h2>

        <p>
        Spam became popular in Hawaii just after World War II.

        During the war, the military consumed large amounts of Spam. Since many troops were stationed in Hawaii, there was a lot of Spam. People liked the taste and eventually "adopted" Spam in Hawaii. Ham musubi was invented by a real Japanese woman in Hawaii.
        </p>


        <h2> Why is ham musubi so popular in Hawaii? </h2>

        <h3>Out.</h3>
        <p>
        Hawaii is very open and Spam musubi is the ultimate portable snack. You can pack it in your backpack before you go hiking or take it to the beach (put a few musubi in your beach bag and snack on it when you get out of the water). Ham musubi don't need to be refrigerated and last a long time, so they're great after a day of physical activity outdoors. Just make sure to bring water or a drink.
        </p>



        <h3>Families/groups</h3>
        <p>
        Hawaii values families and groups. It is not uncommon to find several generations living together in one house. Spam Musubi is a great choice for family reunions, garage parties, bake sales (with butter mocha!), and especially at group events like after-school football games. They're easy to eat and everyone loves them. It's not hard, it's not unnecessary, it's just delicious.
